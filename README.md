# The Faery Tale Adventure - Amiga

This repository contains the source code to the original "The Faery Tale Adventure" published
by MicroIllusions on the Amiga in 1987. It was written by me (Talin) over the course of seven
months.

## State of the code

This code was written very early in my programming career, and in a hurry; the code is of generally
poor quality with few comments. I don't remember very much about it, and probably won't be able
to give useful answers to questions about it.

The code is primarily written in Aztec C, with some 68000 assembly.

I don't know whether it would be possible to actually get the game running on some other platform;
but even so the code may have some historical interest.

## Copyright status

Under U.S. Copyright law, a creator may reclaim the copyright of their work after 35 years,
a process known as "termination of transfer". Accordingly, in 2022 I sent a termination of transfer
notice to Hollyware, Inc., the successors-in-interest to the intellectual property of
MicroIllusions. Unfortunately, they have not responded to my letter or any other inquiries I have
made over the years.

Thus, I cannot say for certain exactly what the copyright status of this code is. However, whatever
rights I do have, I hereby make freely available under an MIT-style permissive license.

## Active Forks

I'm not planning on making any changes to this code, it's purpose is mainly to serve as a historical
reference (so please don't send me PRs). However, a number of folks have forked the code and are
trying to get the game to run in various environments:

* https://github.com/XarkLabs/faery-tale-amiga - an effort to getting the game running on "modern" hardware using SDL.
* https://github.com/tomdionysus/faery-tale-amiga - targeted towards running the game on an Amiga emulator.
